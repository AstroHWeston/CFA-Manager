# CFA Manager
CFA Manager is a Discord utility bot created by [Astro](https://github.com/AstroHWeston). CFA Manager was created to serve the [Chaos Forces Alliance](https://www.roblox.com/communities/35039433/CFA-Chaos-Forces-Alliance) ROBLOX group. It features rich features such as event announcements (Events such as raids and trainings) and a custom disciplinary system!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most of CFA Manager's **current** code has been created using the Discord.js guide. As such, the code may not be optimal as the project was never taken seriously, so apologies for that!
